In this section, we present our main result, which says  that equivalence is decidable for graph-to-graph transductions of bounded treewidth, modulo a certain equivalence on the output graphs. 

\smallparagraph{Counting homomorphisms} The equivalence on output graphs is based on a paper by Grohe, Dell and Rattan~\cite{groheDellRattan2018}, which gives examples of how various relaxations of isomorphism on graphs, notably Weisfeiler-Leman equivalence, can be characterised in terms of counting homomorphisms. 
Define a \emph{homomorphism} from a graph $G$ to a graph $H$ to be any function $h$ from vertices of $G$ to vertices of $H$ which preserves edges in one direction: if there is an edge from $v$ to $w$ in $G$, then there is an edge from $h(v)$ to $h(w)$ in $H$. We write $\homset(G,H)$ for the set of homomorphism from $G$ to $H$. A seminal result of  Lov\'asz~\cite[p.~326]{lovasz1967operations} says that two graphs are isomorphic if and only if they admit the same number of homomorphisms from every graph:
\begin{align*}
\underbrace{G \simeq H}_{\text{isomorphism}} \qquad \text{iff} \qquad  |\homset(F,G)|=|\homset(F,H)| \ \text{for every graph $F$.}
\end{align*}
In~\cite{groheDellRattan2018},
Grohe, Dell and Rattan show that if one restricts the  class of graphs from which $F$ is taken, then one gets various well-studied relaxations of isomorphism. For example, if we only count homomorphisms from graphs $F$ of treewidth at most $k$, then the arising equivalence relation on graphs is Weisfeiler-Leman equivalence of dimension $k$.  The result of~\cite{groheDellRattan2018},  that we use in this paper counts homomorphisms from paths.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:grohe}(\cite[Theorem 2]{groheDellRattan2018})
    For all graphs $G_1,G_2$, the following  are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item for every $i \in \set{0,1,\ldots}$, if $P_i$ is the path of length $n$ then
        \begin{align*}
        |\homset(P_i,G_1) | = |\homset(P_i,G_2)|.
        \end{align*}
        \item $G_1$ and $G_2$  have the same number of vertices, say $n$, and there is an $n \times n$ square matrix $X$ with real coefficients such that:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item each row in $X$ sums up to 1
            \item each column in $X$ sums up to 1
            \item $A_1 X = X A_2$, where $A_i$ is the incidence matrix of graph $G_i$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
Note that a homomorphism from a path of length $n$ is the same thing is a walk of length $n$, i.e.~a sequence of $n+1$ vertices (possibly with repetitions) interleaved with $n$ connecting edges. We call a walk \emph{empty} if it contains no edges. In other words, condition 1 above says that for every $n$, the two graphs have the same number of walks of length $n$. In particular, if we take $n=0$, it implies that the graphs have the same number of vertices.     

Condition 2 in the above theorem can be seen as a relaxation of isomorphism in the following sense. 
If in condition 2 we add the requirement that all coefficients in $X$ are non-negative (real or rational, does not make a difference), then we get  \emph{fractional isomorphism}, which is characterised by homomorphisms from trees~\cite[Theorem 1]{groheDellRattan2018}. If we add the requirement that all coefficients in $X$ are non-negative integers, then we get isomorphism.  

\smallparagraph{Decidable equivalence, modulo counting homomorphisms from paths} 
In the following theorem, we show that equivalence for graph-to-graph \mso transductions of bounded treewidth is decidable, when output graphs are identified modulo the equivalence relation from Theorem~\ref{thm:grohe}. 
% We would have preferred to prove decidability of equivalence modulo isomorphism, but so far we have only managed to apply our technique to the equivalence relation from Theorem~\ref{thm:grohe}.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:path-equivalence}
    Let $\sim$ be the equivalence relation on graphs described in Theorem~\ref{thm:grohe}. 
    The following problem is decidable:
    \decisionproblem{$\sim$-equivalence for graph-to-graph \mso transductions of bounded treewidth.}{ $\ell, k \in \set{1,2,\ldots}$ and two functional graph-to-graph \mso transductions $\Tt$.}{is it the case that for every input $G$ of treewidth at most $\ell$, the two outputs  $\Tt_1(G),\Tt_2(G)$ are equivalent under $\sim$ and have treewidth at most $k$?}
\end{theorem}
% By Lemma~\ref{lem:transduction-to-registers}, the above problem reduces to deciding $\sim$-functionality for nondeterministic \regTsover{\aalg}, where $\aalg$ is the algebra of $k$-sourced graphs. Here, $\sim$-functionality means that output graphs are identified modulo $\sim$. 
 
For the same reasons as in Fact~\ref{fact:equi-decidable}, the above problem is equi-decidable with the $\sim$-functionality problem, where one asks if a nondeterministic transduction can produce two $\sim$-inequivalent outputs on some input, under assumption of bounded treewidth. 

The rest of this section is devoted to showing decidability for the  $\sim$-equivalence problem. We first show how a register transducer can compute a representation of the output graph modulo $\sim$ in terms of a power series. Then we show that equivalence is decidable for register transducers which manipulate such power series. Combining this with the reduction to register transducers from Lemma~\ref{lem:transduction-to-registers}, we get the theorem.

\smallparagraph{Walk series}
An infinite sequence $a_0,a_1,\ldots \in \Nat$ can be visualised as san infinite  polynomial
\begin{align*}
 A = a_0 + a_1x^1 + a_2x^2 + \cdots
\end{align*}
with one variable $x$.
We use the name \emph{power series} for such polynomials, and write $\powerseries{ \Nat}$ for the set of power series. 
We use the name $i$-th term for $a_i$; and we call $a_0$ the constant term.   The power series form a semiring, with addition defined coordinatewise, and product being Cauchy product (see~\cite[part III]{sakarovitch2009elements} for more on rational power series). Among all power series, we are particularly interested in the rational ones: a power series is called \emph{rational} if it can be generated from proper finite power series (a finite power series is one where all but finitely many terms are zero) using the semiring operations $+$ and $\times$ of power series, as well as the following unary  operation called \emph{Kleene plus}:
\begin{align*}
 A^+ \eqdef A + A^2 + A^3 + \cdots.
\end{align*}  
The Kleene plus is defined only if the power series is  \emph{proper} (i.e.~its constant term is zero), which ensures that the infinite sum in $A^+$ is well defined. If $A$ were not proper, then its Kleene plus would need to have the divergent value $a_0 + a_0^2 + a_0^3 + \cdots$ as its constant term.

For a graph $G$, define its \emph{shifted walk series} to be the proper power series 
\begin{align*}
  a_0 x^1 + a_1 x^2 + \cdots \qquad \text{where $a_i$ is the number of walks in $G$ of length $i$.}
\end{align*}
(This is a shift of \emph{walk series} $\sum_{n=0}a_nx^n$, with $a_n$ defined as above; we use the shifted one to avoid technicalities, like e.g. sorted algebras.)
By definition, two graphs are $\sim$-equivalent if and only if they have the same shifted walk series. 
The first step in the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:path-equivalence} is the following lemma, which says that the shifted walk series is always a rational power series, and can be computed by a register transducer.
\begin{restatable}{lemmarestat}{lemcomputePowerSeries}\label{lem:compute-power-series}    
    Define  $\aalg$ to be the  algebra where
    \begin{description}
        \item[Domain:] proper rational power series in $\powerseries \Nat$;
        \item[Operations:] $+$, $\times$, Kleene plus and constant $x$.
    \end{description}
    For every $k \in \set{1,2,\ldots}$ and every nondeterministic register transducer $\Aa$ over the algebra of $k$-sourced graphs, there is a  nondeterministic register transducer $\Bb$ over the algebra  $\aalg$ defined above which makes the following diagram commute (arrows are binary relations):
    \begin{align*}
    \xymatrix@C=1cm{
       &  \trees \Sigma   
        \ar[dr]^{\Bb}
        \ar[dl]_{\Aa} \\
        \txt{graphs of
        treewidth $< k$} \ar[rr]_-{G \mapsto \text{walk series of $G$}}& & \aalg
    }
    \end{align*}
\end{restatable}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch] The main idea in the proof is the compositionality of walk series which is explained below. 
    An \emph{inner walk} in a $k$-sourced graph is defined to be a walk that does not visit sources, with the possible exception of the first and last vertex in the walk.  For $i,j \in \set{1,\ldots,k}$ define  $\varphi_{ij}(G)$ to be the (non-shifted) proper power series where the $n$-th term is the number of nonempty inner walks of length $n$ that begin in the $i$-th source and end in the $j$-th source. In this proof sketch, we show how the series described above can be maintained compositionally
      while applying the operations from the algebra of $k$-sourced graphs. Using variations on this compositionality principle, which take into account some minor technical details, the lemma is proved in the appendix. 
    
      Consider first the fusion of two $k$-sourced graphs: an inner walk in the fusion is the same thing as an inner walk in either the first or second component of the fusion, and these cases are disjoint (because of parallel edges). Therefore, we have:
    \begin{align*}
    \varphi_{ij}(\text{fusion of $G$ and $H$}) =  \varphi_{ij}(G) + \varphi_{ij}(H).
    \end{align*}
    The more interesting case is the forget operation. Suppose that $G$ is a $k$-sourced graph and $G_\ell$ is the result of forgetting source $\ell \in \set{1,\ldots,k}$. An inner walk in $G_\ell$ is either an inner walk in $G$, or it can be decomposed as a composition of: first go to source $\ell$, then take a finite number of loops around source $\ell$, and then leave source $\ell$. Since composing walks corresponds to Cauchy product of power series, we get the  following equation:
    \begin{align*}
    \varphi_{ij}(\text{forget source $\ell$ in $G$}) = \varphi_{ij}(G) + \varphi_{i\ell}(G) \times (1 + (\varphi_{\ell \ell}(G))^+) \times \varphi_{\ell j}(G)
    \end{align*}
    
Using these compositionality ideas, we prove the lemma in the appendix.\end{proof}

\smallparagraph{Equivalence for transducers over rational power series}
Thanks to the above lemma, in order to prove Theorem~\ref{thm:path-equivalence}, it remains to show that equivalence is decidable for register transducers over the algebra $\aalg$ of rational power series that is used in the above lemma.  For this decidability result, we use the embedding of rational power series into rational functions. 

Recall that a \emph{rational function} with variable $x$ is a fraction like 
\begin{align*}
\frac{3x^2 -2x +1}{4x^3 -2},
\end{align*}
where  the numerator and denominator are polynomials in $\Int[x]$, the denominator is nonzero. Addition and multiplication are defined as usual, and a fraction is 0 if and only if its numerator is 0; two fractions are equal if and only if their difference is 0. We write $\Int(x)$ for the rational functions; this is a field. Let $A$ be a proper series. Then $A^+ \times (1-A) = A$, hence $A^+$ can be seen as a fraction of polynomials of $A$; by induction, all proper rational power series  are fractions of polynomials, which yields the embedding. 

Consider a register transducer over the ring $\Int[x]$. Such a register transducer can store a rational function using two registers: one for the enumerator and one for the denominator. The field operations on rational functions can be simulated by term operations using this representation (including division operation; division is the reason of doing the numerator-enumerator construction instead of taking rational functions as a basic ring), and therefore one can reduce the equivalence problem for register transducers over the algebra $\aalg$ to the equivalence problem for register transducers over $\Int[x]$. It remains to show that the latter problem is decidable. This follows from a more general result.

\begin{restatable}{theoremrestat}{thmequivalenceComputableRing}\label{thm:equivalence-for-computable-ring}
    Let $\Ring$ be a commutative ring which is computable (its elements can be enumerated so that the ring operations are computable) and has no zero divisors (if $a,b$ are nonzero, then so is $a \times b$). Then equivalence is decidable for register transducers over $\Ring$.
\end{restatable}
This result is proved in the appendix, by adapting a proof for the special case of the ring of integers that was given in\cite[Theorem 6.6]{seidlManethKemper2018}. 
% Then we lift these results to register transducers that use division. 
Applying the above result to the ring $\Int[x]$, and then the encoding of $\aalg$ in $\Int[x]$, we see that equivalence is decidable for register transducers over $\aalg$. Combining this with Lemma~\ref{lem:compute-power-series}, we finish the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:path-equivalence}.

Also, as a consequence of Theorem \ref{thm:equivalence-for-computable-ring}, we obtain the following result of independent interest.
\begin{restatable}{theorem}{thmequivalenceWithDivision}\label{thm:equivalence-with-division}
    Let $\Ring$ be a ring as in Theorem \ref{thm:equivalence-for-computable-ring} (in particular, it may be a field). Then equivalence is decidable for register transducers over $\Ring$ whose register updates may use division (we assume transducers never divide by 0).
\end{restatable}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\Aa_1, \Aa_2$ be register transducers over $\Ring$, whose updates may use division.  Let $\Bb$ be a register transducer over \Ring, described in above numerator-denominator construction, corresponding to $\Aa_1 - \Aa_2$, that outputs numerator of the output pair. Then $\Aa_1$ and $\Aa_2$ are equivalent if and only if $\Aa_1-\Aa_2$ is equivalent to 0 if and only if $\Bb$ is equivalent to 0.
\end{proof}
