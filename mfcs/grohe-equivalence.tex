In this section, we present our main result, which says  that equivalence is decidable for graph-to-graph transducers of bounded treewidth, modulo a certain equivalence on the output graphs. This equivalence is a relaxation of isomorphism.  

\smallparagraph{Counting homomorphisms} The equivalence on output graphs is based on a paper by Grohe, Dell and Rattan~\cite{groheDellRattan2018}, which gives examples of how various equivalence relations on graphs, notably Weisfeiler-Leman equivalence, can be characterised in terms of counting homomorphisms. 

Define a \emph{homomorphism} from a graph $G$ to a graph $H$ to be any function $h$ from vertices of $G$ to vertices of $H$ which preserves edges in one direction: if there is an edge from $v$ to $w$ in $G$, then there is an edge from $h(v)$ to $h(w)$ in $H$. We write $\homset(G,H)$ for the set of homomorphism from $G$ to $H$. A seminal result of  Lov\'asz~\cite[p.~326]{lovasz1967operations} says that two graphs are isomorphic if and only if they admit the same number of homomorphisms from every graph:
\begin{align*}
\underbrace{G \simeq H}_{\text{isomorphism}} \qquad \text{iff} \qquad  |\homset(F,G)|=|\homset(F,H)| \ \text{for every graph $F$.}
\end{align*}
In~\cite{groheDellRattan2018},
Grohe, Dell and Rattan show that if one restricts the  class of graphs from which $F$ is taken, then one gets various well-studied relaxations of isomorphism. For example, if we only count homomorphisms from graphs $F$ of treewidth at most $k$, then the arising equivalence relation on graphs is Weisfeiler-Leman equivalence of dimension $k$.  The result of~\cite{groheDellRattan2018},  that we use in this paper counts homomorphisms from paths.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:grohe}(\cite[Theorem 2]{groheDellRattan2018})
    For every  graphs $G_1,G_2$, the following  are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item for every $i \in \set{0,1,\ldots}$, if $P_i$ is the path of length $n$ then
        \begin{align*}
        |\homset(P_i,G_1) | = |\homset(P_i,G_2)|.
        \end{align*}
        \item $G_1$ and $G_2$  have the same number of vertices, say $n$, and there is an $n \times n$ square matrix $X$ with real coefficients such that:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item each row in $X$ sums up to 1
            \item each column in $X$ sums up to 1
            \item $A_1 X = X A_2$, where $A_i$ is the incidence matrix of graph $G_i$.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
Note that a homomorphism from a path of length $n$ is the same thing is a walk of length $n$, i.e.~a sequence of $n+1$ vertices connected by edges, possibly with repetitions.  In other words, condition 1 above says that for every $n$, the two graphs have the same number of walks of length $n$. The number of walks of length 0 is the number of vertices, and hence condition 1 implies that the graphs have the same number of vertices.     

Condition 2 in the above theorem can be seen as a relaxation of isomorphism in the following sense. 
If in condition 2 we add the requirement that all coefficients in $X$ are non-negative (real or rational, does not make a difference), then we get  \emph{fractional isomorphism}, which is characterised by homomorphisms from trees~\cite[Theorem 1]{groheDellRattan2018}. If we add the requirement that all coefficients in $X$ are non-negative integers, then we get isomorphism.  

\smallparagraph{Decidable equivalence, modulo counting homomorphisms from paths} 
In the following theorem, we show that equivalence for graph-to-graph \mso transductions of bounded treewidth is decidable, when output graphs are identified modulo the equivalence relation from Theorem~\ref{thm:grohe}. 
% We would have preferred to prove decidability of equivalence modulo isomorphism, but so far we have only managed to apply our technique to the equivalence relation from Theorem~\ref{thm:grohe}.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:path-equivalence}
    Let $\sim$ be the equivalence relation on graphs described in Theorem~\ref{thm:grohe}. 
    The following problem is decidable:
    \decisionproblem{$\sim$-functionality for graph-to-graph \mso transductions of bounded treewidth.}{ $\ell, k \in \set{1,2,\ldots}$ and a graph-to-graph \mso transductions $\Tt$.}{is there some input of treewidth at most $\ell$, which can produce two outputs of treewidth at most $k$ that are not equivalent under $\sim$?}
\end{theorem}
% By Lemma~\ref{lem:transduction-to-registers}, the above problem reduces to deciding $\sim$-functionality for nondeterministic tree-to-$\aalg$ register transducers, where $\aalg$ is the algebra of $k$-sourced graphs. Here, $\sim$-functionality means that output graphs are identified modulo $\sim$. 
 
For the same reasons as in Fact~\ref{fact:equi-decidable}, the above problem is equi-decidable with the $\sim$-equivalence problem, where one asks if two functional transductions produce $\sim$-equivalent outputs, under assumption of bounded treewidth. 

The rest of this section is devoted to showing decidability for the  $\sim$-functionality problem. We first show how a register transducer can compute a representation of the output graph modulo $\sim$ in terms of a power series (Section~\ref{sec:power-series}), and then we show that equivalence is decidable for register transducers which manipulate such power series (Section ~\ref{sec:pol-transducers-any-ring} and Section~\ref{sec:decide-power-series}). Combining this with the reduction to register transducers from Lemma~\ref{lem:transduction-to-registers}, we get the theorem.

\subsection{Computing the power series for walks in a graph}
\label{sec:power-series}
Define a \emph{univariate formal power series over a semiring $\Ring$} to be  sequence of semiring elements $a_0,a_1,\ldots$ which is represented as an infinite univariate polynomial
\begin{align*}
 A = a_0 + a_1x^1 + a_2x^2 + \cdots.
\end{align*}
We simply say power series, instead of univariate formal power series.
We use the name $i$-th term for $a_i$; and we call $a_0$ the constant term.
We write $\powerseries{\Ring}$ for the  power series over a semiring $\Ring$; this is a semiring. Among all power series, we are particularly interested in the rational ones: a power series is called \emph{rational} if it can be generated from finite power series (a finite power series is one where all but finitely many terms are zero) using the semiring operations $+$ and $\times$ of power series, as well as the following unary  operation called \emph{Kleene plus}:
\begin{align*}
 A^+ \eqdef A + A^2 + A^3 + \cdots,
\end{align*}   
which  is defined only when the constant term   in $A$ is zero. The assumption on a zero constant term ensures that the infinite sum in $A^+$ is well defined: under this assumption, the $i$-th term in $A^j$ with $j>i$ is zero. 


For a graph $G$, define its \emph{walk series} to be the power series 
\begin{align*}
  a_1 x^1 + a_2x^2 + \cdots \qquad \text{where $a_i$ is the number of walks in $G$ of length $i$.}
\end{align*}
By definition, two graphs with the same number of vertices are $\sim$-equivalent if and only if they have the same walk series. 
The first step in the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:path-equivalence} is the following lemma, which says that the walk series is always rational, and can be computed by a register transducer.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:compute-power-series}    
    Define  $\aalg$ to be the  algebra where
    \begin{description}
        \item[Domain:]power series in $\powerseries \Nat$ which are rational and have a  zero constant term;
        \item[Operations:] $+$, $\times$, Kleene plus and constants $1$ and $x$.
    \end{description}
    For every $k \in \set{1,2,\ldots}$ and every nondeterministic  \treetotreewidth{ k} register transducer $\Aa$, there is a nondeterministic tree-to-$\aalg$ register transducer $\Bb$ which makes the following diagram commute (arrows are binary relations):
    \begin{align*}
    \xymatrix@C=1cm{
       &  \trees \Sigma   
        \ar[dr]^{\Bb}
        \ar[dl]_{\Aa} \\
        \txt{graphs of
        treewidth $< k$} \ar[rr]_-{G \mapsto \text{walk series of $G$}}& & \natx
    }
    \end{align*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    
    %J
    
        % The proof is an adaptation of a weighted version of the usual ''DFA to regular expression conversion'' (i.e. weighted automaton to rational power series), with state elimination corresponding to source forgetting.
    
        
        % Define an \emph{internal walk} to be a walk that does not visit any sources,  with the possible exception of the first and last vertices in the walk, which are allowed to be sources. 
        Define the \emph{type} of a vertex in a $k$-sourced graph to be  $i$ if the vertex is the $i$-th source for $i \in \set{1,\ldots,k}$, and $0$ otherwise. For types
        $i,j \in \set{0,\ldots,k}$,
        define an  $(i,j)$-walk to be a walk where the first vertex has type $i$, the last vertex has type $j$, and the remaining vertices in the walk are not sources. Define the $(i,j)$-walk series of a $k$-sourced graph, denoted by $\varphi_{ij}(G)$, to be the power series where the $n$-th term is the number of nonempty $(i,j)$-walks of length $n$. (In particular, the constant term  of this power series is zero, since we only consider nonempty walks.) Finally, define 
        \begin{align*}
        \varphi_{ij} : \text{$k$-sourced graphs} \to \aalg^{\set{0,\ldots,k}^2} \qquad G \mapsto (\varphi_{ij}(G))_{i,j \in \set{0,\ldots,k}}.
        \end{align*}
        The main observation is that $\varphi$ is an algebra homomorphism, in the following sense.
        \begin{claim}
            For every term operation $f$ 
            in the algebra of $k$-sourced graphs, there is a term operation $f^\varphi$ in the algebra $\aalg$ which makes the following diagram commute
            \begin{align*}
            \xymatrix{
                (\text{$k$-sourced graphs})^X 
                \ar[r]^f
                \ar[d]_{\varphi^X}
                &
                 (\text{$k$-sourced graphs})^Y
                \ar[d]^\varphi
                \\
                \aalg^{\set{0,\ldots,k}^2 \times X}
                \ar[r]_{f^\varphi}
                &
                \aalg^{\set{0,\ldots,k}^2 \times Y}
            }
            \end{align*}
        \end{claim}
        Before proving the claim, we use it to finish the proof of the lemma. Suppose that $\Aa$ has registers $\Ring$. The automaton $\Bb$ has the same input alphabet, and registers $\set{0,\ldots,k}^2  \times R$.  The register updates of $\Bb$ are defined by applying the operation $f \mapsto f^\varphi$ to the register updates of $\Aa$. 
        If $\Ring$ is the output register of $\Aa$, then the output register of $\Bb$ is $(0,0,r)$.  From the claim it follows 
        \begin{align*}
        \text{$\Aa$ can output $G$ on input $t$} \qquad \iff \qquad 
        \text{$\Bb$ can output $\varphi_{00}(G)$ on input $t$}.
        \end{align*}
        Since $\varphi_{00}(G)$ is the walk series of $G$ when $G$ has no sources, the lemma follows. It remains to prove the claim.

        \begin{proof} 
            It is enough to prove the claim for the case when $f$ is one of the basic operations in the algebra of $k$-sourced graphs. In particular, $Y$ has one element. Here the proof is similar to conversion of a nondeterministic automaton into a regular expression, as in the Kleene Theorem.
            
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Suppose that $f$ is a constant, which represents a  $k$-sourced graph where all vertices are sources. Then we have 
                \begin{align*}
                \varphi_{ij}(f) = \begin{cases}
                    x & \text{if there is an edge from $i$ to $j$ in $f$}\\
                    0 & \text{otherwise.}
                \end{cases}
                \end{align*}
                \item Suppose that $f$ is the  basic operation which inputs two $k$-sourced graphs and outputs their fusion.  
                An $(i,j)$-walk in the fusion $f(G_1,G_2)$ is either an $(i,j)$-walk in $G_1$ or an $(i,j)$-walk in $G_2$ -- this is because vertices between endpoints cannot be sources. These cases are disjoint, except the hypothetical walk of length 1 from $i$ to $j$. %Furthermore, these cases are disjoint, since we are working with graphs that have parallel edges.
  		This leads to the following equation for fusions:
                \begin{align*}
                \varphi_{ij}(f(G_1,G_2)) = \begin{cases}
                	\varphi_{ij}(G_1) + \varphi_{ij}(G_2) - x, \text{ if both $G_1$ and $G_2$ have an edge $(i, j)$}\\
                	\varphi_{ij}(G_1) + \varphi_{ij}(G_2), \text{ otherwise}.
                \end{cases}
                \end{align*}
                The right hand side uses component-wise addition, which is a basic operation in $\aalg$.
                \item The last case is when $f$ is a unary operation which forgets  source $c \in \set{1,\ldots,k}$.  Let then $G$ be a $k$-sourced graph. A nonempty $(i,j)$-walk in $f(G)$ is either a nonempty $(i,j)$-walk in $G$, or it has the form
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item a nonempty $(i,c)$-walk in $G$; followed by 
                    \item finitely many (possibly zero) nonempty  $(c,c)$-walks in $G$; followed by
                    \item a nonempty $(c,i)$-walk in $G$.
                \end{enumerate}
                This leads to the following equation:
                \begin{align*}
                \varphi_{ij}(f(G)) = \varphi_{ij}(G)) +  \varphi_{ic}(G) \times (1+ \varphi_{cc}(G)^+)  \times \varphi_{cj}(G).
                \end{align*}                
            \end{itemize}
        \end{proof}
        
\end{proof}

\subsection{Equivalence for register transducers that compute walk series}\label{sec:decide-power-series}
By Lemmas~\ref{lem:transduction-to-registers} and~\ref{lem:compute-power-series}, the  equivalence problem from Theorem~\ref{thm:path-equivalence} reduces to equivalence for nondeterministic tree-to-$\aalg$ register transducers, where $\aalg$ is the algebra from Lemma~\ref{lem:compute-power-series}. In this section, we complete the proof the theorem by showing that the latter problem is decidable.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:functionality-decidable-power-series} If $\aalg$ is the algebra from Lemma~\ref{lem:compute-power-series}, then equivalence is decidable for nondeterministic tree-to-$\aalg$ register transducers. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We will reduce to equivalence of tree-to-\Zrat polynomial transducers, which is shown decidable in Corollary \ref{cor:equivalence-pol-transducers-Zrat}.
	The following equation allows to simulate Kleene plus by division operation; observe that for any $f$ we have $ff^+ + f = f^+$, and in consequence
	$$
	f^+ = \frac{f}{1-f}.
	$$
	This makes tree-to-\aalg register transducer a tree-to-\Zrat polynomial transducer \emph{with division}, i.e. a polynomial transducers with additional feature that register updates can use division operation.
	The rest of the proof is devoted to showing decidability of equivalence of polynomial transducers with division.
	\begin{lemma}
		Equivalence of tree-to-$\Ring$ polynomial transducers with division is decidable, for a ring with no zero divisors $\Ring$.
	\end{lemma}
	\begin{proof}
		We will adapt the construction of projective line.
		Consider the following representation of elements of $\Ring$: a pair $(x,y)\in \Ring^2$ represents $\frac{x}{y} \in \Ring$. This representation is not unique, and is undefined on some pairs. Then addition, multiplication and, importantly, division of elements of $\Ring$ can be realised as polynomial operations on their representations in $\Ring^2$. This is employed in definition of the following algebra \balg:
		%\begin{align*}
		%	&\frac{x}{y} + \frac{z}{t} = \frac{xt+yz}{yt},\\ 
		%	&\frac{x}{y} \cdot \frac{z}{t} = \frac{xz}{yt},\\
		%	&\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^+ = \frac{\frac{x}{y}}{1-\frac{x}{y}} = \frac{x}{y-x},
		%\end{align*}
		%and define algebra $\balg$ the following way:
		\algebradefinition{$\Ring \times \Ring$}{$+_B, \cdot_B$ of arity 2, $^+$ of arity 1:
			\begin{align*}
			&(x,y) +_B (z,t) = (xt+yz, yt),\\
			&(x,y)\cdot_B(z,t) = (xz, yt),\\
			&(x,y)^{+_B} = (x, y-x).
			\end{align*}}
		
		Also observe that there is a ''zero-testing'' polynomial function $\eqzeroinalgb$ that satisfies
		$$
		\eqzeroinalgb(x,y) = 0 \iff (x,y) \text { represents } 0,
		$$
		that is, $\eqzeroinalgb(x,y) = x$.
		
		Now, for $\Aa$ being tree-to-$\Ring$ polynomial transducer with division, one can make a tree-to-$\balg$ polynomial transducer $\Bb$, using equations above. Then for each input tree $t$, $\Bb(t)$ represent $\Aa(t)$.
		
		Thus the reduction is as follows: for polynomial transducers with division $\Aa_1, \Aa_2$ take polynomial transducer $\Bb_{1,2}$ corresponding to $\Aa_1-\Aa_2$. Then $\Aa_1 \equiv \Aa_2$
		%\Leftrightarrow
		if and only if 
		$\eqzeroinalgb(\Bb_{1,2}) \equiv 0$,
		that is,
		polynomial transducer $\eqzeroinalgb(\Bb_{1,2})$ obtained by composing output function of $\Bb_{1,2}$ with $\eqzeroinalgb$, is equivalent to $0$.
	\end{proof}	
\end{proof}
