\section{Perspectives}
In this section we discuss future perspectives of our approach. First direction is taking other polynomials or series. Let us start with two well known graph polynomials: Tutte polynomial and characteristic polynomial.

Tutte polynomial, denote it $T(G)$, counts many substructures of given "rank" in $G$, e.g. spanning forests, colourings. If we assume that a register transducer $\join$s along at most one vertex at a time, then, due to recurrences $T(G \cup H) = T(G) \cdot T(H), T(G\sqcup_a H) = T(G) \cdot T(H)$, Tutte polynomial of outputted graph can be easily computed by a register transducer. The distinguishing power of Tutte polynomial is however very low, at least in our context: all trees with $n$ edges have the same Tutte polynomial ($x^n$).

Let us now move to characteristic polynomial. Interestingly, two graphs have the same characteristic polynomial if and only if they have the same numbers of length-$n$ closed walks for all $n$ (cf. remarks after Theorem \ref{thm:grohe}). Let us assume again that a register transducer $\join$s only along at most one vertex at a time. For a sourced graph $G$, define $\varphi(G) = ({\widetilde{G}}^a, \overline{G}^a)_{a \in \sources(G)}$, where $({\widetilde{G}}^a, \overline{G}^a)_{a \in \sources(G)}$ is the following "split" of characteristic polynomial, induced by Laplace expansion of $A_G-t\cdot I$ at a row corresponding to vertex $a$:
$$
	\det(A_G-t\cdot I) = (-t)\cdot \underbrace{\det(A_{G\setminus a} - t\cdot I)}_{{\widetilde{G}}^a} + \underbrace{\sum_{v \in (G-a)}G^a_v \cdot \ldots}_{\overline{G}^a}.
$$
Now take two graphs $G, H$ with a common vertex $a$. If we order vertices of $G$ and $H$ so that $a$ is the last vertex of $G$ and the first vertex of $H$, adjacency matrix of $G\sqcup_aH$ looks like this:\\
\input{pic-matadjacency}
Now, take Laplace expansion at row corresponding to vertex $a$:
\begin{multline*}
	\det(A_{G\sqcup_a H}) = \sum_{v \in (G- a)} G^1_v \cdot \ldots + (-t) \cdot \ldots + \sum_{w \in (H- a)} H^1_w \cdot \ldots = \ldots (\text{ to be ctd. })
\end{multline*}
Observe that $v$-cofactor, $a$-cofactor and $w$-cofactor, for $v\in (G-a), w \in (H-a)$ are determinants of, respectively:\\

\begin{scope}[xshift=\picPrzesuniecie + \picPrzesuniecie]
\input{pic-Laplace-exp-at-winH}
\end{tikzpicture}
\\
Now, by the fact that $\left|\begin{array}{c|c}
A & \ast\\
\hline
0 & B
\end{array}\right|
=
\left|\begin{array}{c|c}
A & 0 \\
\hline
\ast & B
\end{array}\right|
=
\det(A) \cdot \det(B),
$
where $A,B$ are square matrices, possibly of different size,
we get $\det(A_{G\sqcup_a H})$ is equal to
$$
\ldots = {\widetilde{G}}^a \cdot \det(H') + (-t) \cdot \det(G') \cdot \det(H') + \det(G') \cdot {\widetilde{H}}^a,
$$
that is,
\begin{equation}
	{\widetilde{G}}^a\cdot\overline{H}^a + (-t) \cdot {\widetilde{G}}^a \cdot {\widetilde{H}}^a + \overline{G}^a \cdot {\widetilde{H}}^a. \text{}(why left aligned?)
\end{equation}
Lat us remark that \cite{contrerasGluingLaplacians20} provides the same proof of above fact. It also studies the behaviour of graph Laplacians after $\join$ operation (called \emph{interface gluing} in the paper), which are determinants of other matrices associated to graphs.
The distinguishing power of characteristic polynomial is also low in our context -- a result \cite{schwenkCospectral73} due to Schwenk says that almost all trees, in a sense of probability, are not uniquely characterized by their characteristic polynomial.

Second direction of further research might be to search for classess of graphs that admit polynomials or power series with high distinguighing power. We conjecture that (edge-labelled version of) walk series (i.e. $\sum_{n,m=0}^{\infty}\eta_{n,m} a^n b^m \in \mathbb{Z}[[a,b]]$, where $\eta_{n,m}$ equals number of walks with $n$ $a$-edges and $m$ $b$-edges) is injective on the class of edge-labelled cycles (which, by a suitable encoding, can be seen as a subclass of unlabelled graphs of pathwidth 4 and treewidth 2). %dodając 1 lub 2widełki w każdym wierzchołku cyklu, w zależności czy ma etykiete a czy b
